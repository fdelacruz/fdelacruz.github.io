			<p>My name is Francisco. For the last year and a half I have been practicing Ashtanga Yoga, a type of yoga popularized by the late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Pattabhi_Jois">Sri K. Pattabhi Jois</a> or <span style="color:red">Guruji</span> as he was affectionately known and who's see picture you see up top. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root yuj, which means "to join" or "to yoke". Ashtanga, as it is normally referred to strives to achieve this union with what it calls Tristana or the union of Vinyasa, Bandha and Drishti. 
				<h3>Vinyasa</h3>
				<p>
					The term vinyāsa refers to the alignment of movement and breath, a method which turns static asanas into a dynamic flow.The length of one inhale or one exhale dictates the length of time spent transitioning between asanas. Asanas are then held for 5 breath
				</p>
				<h3>Bandha</h3>
				<p>
					This is the muscle locking/contraction, which focuses energy in the body and is closely tied to the breath. It also allows energy to flow.
				</p>
				<h3>Drishti</h3>
				<p>
					Drishti (dṛṣṭi), or focused gaze, is a means for developing concentrated intention. The most common is Ūrdhva, or upward gazing, where the eyes are lifted, with the spine aligned from crown to tailbone. This technique is employed in a variety of asanas.

					There are, in total, nine drishtis that instruct the yoga student in directing his or her gaze. Each asana is associated with a particular drishti. They include:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Aṅguṣṭha madhyai: to the thumb</li>
					<li>Bhrūmadhya: to the third eye, or between the eyebrows</li>
					<li>Nāsāgrai: at the tip of the nose (or a point six inches from the tip)</li>
					<li>Hastagrai: to the palm, usually the extended hand</li>
					<li>Pārśva: to the left/right side</li>
					<li>Ūrdhva: to the sky, or upwards</li>
					<li>Nābhicakra: to the navel</li>
					<li>Pādayoragrai: to the toes</li>
				</ul>

			</p>
			<h3>Sequences & Series</h3>
			<p>
				Ashtanga Yoga is different from many yoga classes in the west in that the order of asanas is completely predefined.
			</p>
			<p>
				A practice will comprise four main parts: an

				<ol>
					<li>"opening sequence,"</li>
					<li>one of the six main "series",</li>
					<li>a back-bending sequence, and</li>
					<li>a set of inverted asanas, referred to as the "finishing sequence."</li>
				</ol>

			</p>
			<p>
				Practice always ends with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savasana">savasana</a>.
			</p>
			<h3>Daily Practice</h3>
			<p>
				Daily or regular practice is highly emphasized in Ashtanga Yoga. Students are encouraged to practice 6 days a week, preferably in the morning, and to take rest on Saturdays as well as the days of the full and new moon (commonly referred to as moon days by ashtanga practitioners). Women are also encouraged to take rest on the first one to three days of menstruation so as not to disturb their cycles.
			</p>
			<h3>Mantra</h3>
			<p>
				The Ashtanga practice is traditionally started with the following Sanskrit mantra:
			</p>

			<div class="mantras">
				<p>
					vande gurūṇāṁ caraṇāravinde saṁdarśitasvātmasukhāvabodhe
					<br>
					<br>
					niḥ śreyase jāṅ̇galikāyamāne saṁsāra hālāhala mohaśāntyai
					<br>
					<br>
					ābāhu puruṣākāraṁ śaṅ̇khacakrāsi dhāriṇam
					<br>
					<br>
					sahasra śirasaṁ śvetam praṇamāmi patañjalim
					<br>
					<br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				which is roughly translated into English as:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<div class="mantras">
					<p>
						I bow to the lotus feet of the gurus,
						<br>
						The awakening happiness of one's own self revealed,
						<br>
						Beyond better, acting like the jungle physician,
						<br>
						Pacifying delusion, the poison of samsara.
						<br>
						Taking the form of a man to the shoulders,
						<br>
						Holding a conch, a discus, and a sword,
						<br>
						One thousand heads white,
						<br>
						To Patanjali, I salute.
						<br>
					</p>
				</div>
			</blockquote>


			<p>
				and closes with the mangala mantra:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<div class="mantras">
					svasti prajābhyaḥ paripālayantāṁ nyāyena mārgeṇa mahīṁ mahīśāḥ
					<br>
					<br>
					gobrāhmaṇebhyaḥ śubhamastu nityaṁ lokāḥ samastāḥ sukhino bhavantu
					<br>
				</div>
			</blockquote>


			<p>
				which is roughly translated into English as:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<div class="mantras">
					May prosperity be glorified,
					<br>
					may rulers (administrators) rule the world with law and justice,
					<br>
					may divinity and erudition be protected.
					<br>
					May all beings be happy and prosperous.
					<br>
				</div>
			</blockquote>
