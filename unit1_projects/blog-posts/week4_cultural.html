      <h3>Tech World: Where the women, and the minorities, aren't.</h3>
      <p>
        The numbers are a funhouse mirror image of the American workforce, which is 47% female, 16% Hispanic, 12% black and 12% Asian, 
        according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Google released its diversity numbers Wednesday after it (and most other tech firms) have spent years without disclosing such figures. Just 1% of its tech staff are black. Two percent are Hispanic. The one well-represented minority group is Asians, who make up 34% of the company's tech workers. Eighty-three percent of Google's tech workers internationally are male.For non-tech jobs, the number is 52%. The reason for the disparity 
        is that White and Asian men are much more likely to have access and take advantage of technical schooling that leads to jobs at tech firms than historically disadvantaged minorities.

        "Women and underrepresented minorities have been denied access to resources and opportunities that would allow them to enter and succeed in computer science," said Coleen Carrigan, an anthropologist who researches high-tech cultures.

        "Computer science education rewards students with early exposure to computers and fails to nurture those who are new to them and apprehensive," Carrigan said.

        Programming Bootcamps like Dev Bootcamps are taking the first step in including women and other minorities by allowing them to take advantage of a $500 scholarship. "The tech world is notoriously unrepresentative of the larger population. We believe that the sooner that changes, the better off we all are." it reads in the application. it might not seen like a whole lot, but it is an incentive and also representative of the founders philosophy of this organization. 
        That way of thinking is what led me sign up with the hopes to join the tech world.
