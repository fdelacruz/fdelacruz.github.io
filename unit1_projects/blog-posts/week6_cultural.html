    <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
    <p>
    The stereotype threat refers to people potentially re-affirming a negative
    stereotype of themselves. I have personally experienced this once while
    applying to several programming schools around the country. 
    </p>

    <p>
    A very famous Bootcamp in New York among them did a number on me. 
    I was rejected. Not once, not twice, but three times in a roll. 
    I really wanted to get in. You see by that point I had been self-studying 
    Ruby and Rails for around six months and was ready to take it to the next level. 
    The admisions gods thought otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
    Right before that last rejection email I was on a roll about learning and was making great
    progress all by myself. That all came to a screaching stop then. Feelings of
    being too old, too black, and with a beard to boot took hold. I put the
    books down, summitted my last git commits and hung the gloves.
    </p>
    <p>What was he point I thought. I will never make it in this business.</p>

    <p>And so I took an almost six month absense and found refuge in my yoga practice which despite the fact that I may
    not be the most bendy, she did not judge me. Ever. All that she required of
    me was that came visit her consistently. If I did that I would get what I put
    in. </p>
    <p>Suddenly, one day, I got the urge to come back. I still don't where it
    came from. I just know that I needed to. That day I dusted off my terminal
    and started my beloved Vim. At that point I had forgotten everything. I had
    to learn from scratch even how to navigate around the screen.</p>
    <p>That's when I realized how far I had come before. I was bent in not letting happen
    again. Nobody would disuade me from reaching my goals. Ever again.</p>
    <p>That's when I applied to DBC.</p>
    <p>Needeeless to say I was completely disbelieve. I may or may still not
    gotten over it completely.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, I intend on taking this opportunity to raise awareness to
    this problem; to be of help and support others that may be going through
    similar road blocks.</p>
