    <h3>Dealing With Conflict</h3>
    <p>
    Life could be traumatic, shocking, even terrible. 
    We are ALL "damaged" goods, by our experiences in it. We all get our hearts and feelings broken one way or another. The difference lies in how we react to these inevitable events.
    </p> 
    <p>
    According to Dr. Sylvan one way to deal is shame. She states tha shame is "a
    protective response to keep us connected to the group rather than wondering
    off dangerously by ourselves.It has been given to us to help us survive and
    to eliminate it would not be safe."
    </p>
    <p>
    So it turns out that the way the majority of us deal with shame has been
    studied. Dr. L. Nathason came up with what he calls "The Compass of Shame",
    with each pole being a "scripted set of things to say to oneself and ways of behaving towards others."
    </p>
    <p>
    Starting from the North end of the compass, we have "Withdrawl", followed by
    "Attack self", "Avoidance"  and ending with "Attack Other" at the west end
    of the compass.
    </p>
    <p>
    I tend to be passive-aggressive when faced with conflict. So I would associate myself
    with having a "Withdrawl" reaction to dealing with potentially shameful
    experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
    The most recent emotional conflict I experienced was Thusrday. I went to
    show my grandmother a pair of eyeglasses that I just received in the mail.
    She inmediately criticized them and even said their were rather "ordinary".
    Meaning that they were ugly. My aunt who was present tried to intervine in
    my defense by saying they looked good and added that I liked was all that
    mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
    I remember walking away seemingly unaffected by grandmother's comments.
    Clearly that wasn't the case because I kept thinking about it and how I
    wasn't going to say anything. I was trying to talk myself of how meaningless
    this and that I should just let go.
    </p>
    <p>
    Eventually, a couple of days latter. I told of how it wasn't nice what
    she said. By then unfortunately, she had forgotten or denied that she that
    and instead accused of harboring stuff in my heart instead of talking to
    her.
    </p>
    <p>
    I think I should've confronted her kindly right then an there when she
    said what she said. That would've saved me the hearthache of harboring stuff
    for days instead of just bringing it up.
    </p>
    <p>
    I've learned that I need less passive-aggressive, more upfront with my feelings and what I have in
    my mind.
