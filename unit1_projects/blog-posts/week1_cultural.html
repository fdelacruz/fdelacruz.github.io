      <h3> Cultural Post</h3>
      <p>
        The Kitchen vs Table analogy really resonated with me. 
        I think that was a brilliant way to put what one should not only expect but also bring into this experience we are about to have together at DBC.
        I think DBC has put together a great set of resources even at the prep stage and I cannot wait what the professors in class will be like. I see myself engaging 100% percent in my commitment from what I'm bent of getting from the program. Saying that I'm excited and nervous would be putting it very lightly and an understatement really of how I have been feeling since I made my decision. Sometimes I wake in the middle of the night scared, wondering what I've done, if this is the right decision. Eventually I fall back asleep after reassuring myself that this is my decision, and me simply taking control of my future.
