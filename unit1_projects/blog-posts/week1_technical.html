      <h3>Some of my favorite sites:</h3>
      <h3><a class="link" href="http://quora.com" target="_blank">Quora.com</a></h3>

      <p>
        Quora has become in a short period of time one of my top favorite sites. Is where I go to read what people are saying about all sort of topics be it technical, political, food, yoga or Game of Thrones. The eyes are inmediately drawn to the middle of the site for it is here the feed loads the latest post from the topics you are following. I would describe as visually clean, simple, pleasant, pretty and minimal. The site solves the problem of having the to search the internet for seemingly obscure questions. You can find the answers for every question no matter how odd here. If you are wondering chances are it is addessed. In that respect the content of the site is very practical, informative, focused, relevant, and recent. The visual and the site's content go hand in hand and correspond closely. It is very easy to search and find questions and/or topics about every conceivable subject.
        I know that I can find what people's opinion on anything I may be wondering and get updates on these once I subscribe to the individual question or topics.

      <h3><a class="link" href="http://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">StackOverflow.com</a></h3>
      <img src="images/stackoverflow.jpg" alt="StackOverflow" height="300" width="500">
      <p>
        StackOverflow is without a doubt the "goto" for every programmer's need in terms of getting questions answered very fast. The site is frequented by the most knowledgeable people in the planet and you are bound to find or get help no matter what you issue may be. The site has a no-frills quality to it, examplified by the again clean, simple, minimal look it sports. This is very welcoming which is great because the site has becomed a hub for developers to get and give help. Its look go well together with the no-nonsense of the community. It is straight to the point and nothing else. It is extremelly easy to reach positive results and related questions.

      <p>
        Amazon is the perfect example of that well built e-commerce web site. It is where I first go not only to purchase products, but also to conduct research on anything I may be interested in buying at the time. I like to read other peoples opinions and their review system is second to none. The reviewers also invest a lot time in sharing their opinions extensively which the system as a whole. I would describe the site as pleasant, clean, friendly, easy to navigate, and helpful. As one logs the site it presents you with products you may be interested in based on past searches. Is it usually spot on which is amazing and helpful. The site also features one of the fastest, smartest search systems in the world.
