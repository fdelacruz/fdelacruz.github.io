      <h3>My Thinking Style and Learning</h3>

      <p>
        It turns out I'm mostly Abstract Random, Abstract Sequential thinking style which wouldn't surprise anybody that knows me in the least.
        As an mostly Abstract Random Thinker I organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments. Which I think why DBC is such a good fit for me so far. Their emphasis in making us strive to develop good people skills is something that greatly resonates with me. I'm a people person and that was something that made question my career choices and ask myself can I be that and still be a developer? I was like many people under the misconception  that a technical person had to be awkward and wear pocket protector with think prescription glasses.

        I'm also it turns out, an Abstract Sequential Thinker which means I love the world of theory and abstract thought. That couldn't define me any more accurate. I love to use my brain to analyst ideas and ponder over all types of issues concerning social and spiritual issues. I once considered the path of becoming a minister, but my idea of God didn't quite align with that of the church I was part of. I left the church and led me to find less judgmental more loving and accepting circles.
