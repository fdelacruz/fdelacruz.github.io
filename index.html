      <h3>Ruby Classes</h3>
      <p>
        I remember once my then girlfriend asking me what Objected Oriented was and
        me utterly failing at coming out with a simple clear answer. It was Albert
        Einstein who said, "If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't
        understand it yourself." Not that I'm remotely suggesting that she shared
        similarities any way with a six year old because that would not be nice, to the six year old.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simply put, Ruby Classes and Objects model real-world objects in intuitive
        ways. Classes  group information together by creating a notion of object
        attributes and methods that are directly associated with specific objects.
        Classes are the mechanism to "construct" these objects, the blue print if
        you will, and contain information about said attributes and classes. Classes are one degree
        abstracted from objects in that they generalize a given object and allow you
        to repeatedly construct it with different attributes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/fdelacruz/ae798d16b42c9767858b.js"></script>
      </p>
      <p>
        As I mentioned, Classes contain information about the attributes (data) and
        methods (functions that act on said data) of their  objects. Let's go
        through them one-by-one in our Car example.
      </p>
      <p>
        First we define the initialize class. This helps you
        'create' an object -- you use this method to generate new Car object or
        instance. It is a function that takes two inputs: what type of car it is, and what color it
        is. These inputs are then fed into the two attributes that each Car has,
        "@type" and "@color". The "@" symbol is syntax and part of all
        'instance variables', i.e. variables that your object contains once it is
        initialized.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the initialize method, there are several others methods that
        can act on each Car object.  In this case we have drive_car and honk. One takes an input
        (miles) and puts out, "You drove XX many miles", where XX denotes the
        miles input into the function. The other method, honk, simply puts "Honk!"
      </p>
      <p>
        We have created a Class--a constructor, essentially--which generates Car
        objects with associated data (attributes) and functions that act on said
        data (methods).
